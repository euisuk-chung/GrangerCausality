## Dataset Used
**Description:**
- The advertising dataset captures the sales revenue generated with respect to advertisement costs across multiple channels like radio, tv, and newspapers.

- It is required to understand the impact of ad budgets on the overall sales.

**Acknowledgement:**
- The dataset is taken from Kaggle

**Objective:**
