# GrangerCausality
Granger Causality Test

## Dataset Used
**Description:**
- The advertising dataset captures the sales revenue generated with respect to advertisement costs across multiple channels like radio, tv, and newspapers.

- It is required to understand the impact of ad budgets on the overall sales.

**Acknowledgement:**
- The dataset is taken from Kaggle

**Objective:**
- Understand the Dataset & cleanup (if required).
- Build Regression/GC(GrangerCausality) models to predict the sales w.r.t a single & multiple features.
- Also evaluate the models & compare their respective scores like R2, RMSE, etc.
